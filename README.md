# JetBrains-IDE-settings
JetBrains makes IDE software that is far beyond adequate.  I personally feel like we need a innovator out there to break our minds and show us a new aesthetic paragigm when it comes to coding interface and adjacent hoo-ha, if anyone knows what that is gonna look like, go ahead and let us know down below in the comments.  This is a youtube video, right?  

Set yourself up, and make it look good.  You can borrow whatever you want from here.  You can have opinions about it.  Do it.
